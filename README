Building
========

I made some changes to the original BYACC/J Makefile to allow it to compile on
Linux. You may need to customize it to your system. 

Try:

$ cd src
$ make linux

Which should produce an executable inside the src/ directory called `yacc.linux'.

License
=======

Licensing details for the original BYACC/J source code can be found on their
website [http://byaccj.sourceforge.net] and/or in applicable source files.

My changes are placed in the public domain and of course, I make no representations
that this code will work as intended or at all. Indeed, it may even cause your 
computer to explode and collapse the economy of a small south asian state.
